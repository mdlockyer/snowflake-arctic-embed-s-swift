# Model pack

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `model.ae8` | Int8 quantized weights of `Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-s` (33.8 MB, fetched by `scripts/fetch_model.sh`) |
| `vocab.txt` | WordPiece vocabulary, unmodified from the original model |

This is the only model format the library reads. `ArcticEmbedS.fromDir("model")` loads it and
packs the weights for the host CPU's SIMD backend at startup (~2.8 ms).

## Fetching
